            <remarks>
            Delta T is the discrepancy between times measured using an atomic clock
            and times based on observations of the Earth's rotation, which is gradually
            slowing down over time. Delta T = TT - UT, where
            TT = Terrestrial Time, based on atomic time, and
            UT = Universal Time, civil time based on the Earth's rotation.
            Astronomy Engine defaults to using a Delta T function defined by
            Espenak and Meeus in their "Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses".

             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The floating point number of days of Universal Time since noon UTC January 1, 2000.
             Astronomy Engine approximates UTC and UT1 as being the same thing, although they are
             not exactly equivalent; UTC and UT1 can disagree by up to plus or minus 0.9 seconds.
             This approximation is sufficient for the accuracy requirements of Astronomy Engine.
            
             Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) is the international standard for legal and civil
             timekeeping and replaces the older Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) standard.
             UTC is kept in sync with unpredictable observed changes in the Earth's rotation
             by occasionally adding leap seconds as needed.
            
             UT1 is an idealized time scale based on observed rotation of the Earth, which
             gradually slows down in an unpredictable way over time, due to tidal drag by the Moon and Sun,
             large scale weather events like hurricanes, and internal seismic and convection effects.
             Conceptually, UT1 drifts from atomic time continuously and erratically, whereas UTC
             is adjusted by a scheduled whole number of leap seconds as needed.
            
             The value in `ut` is appropriate for any calculation involving the Earth's rotation,
             such as calculating rise/set times, culumination, and anything involving apparent
             sidereal time.
            
             Before the era of atomic timekeeping, days based on the Earth's rotation
             were often known as *mean solar days*.

             Terrestrial Time days since noon on January 1, 2000.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Terrestrial Time is an atomic time scale defined as a number of days since noon on January 1, 2000.
             In this system, days are not based on Earth rotations, but instead by
             the number of elapsed [SI seconds](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html)
             divided by 86400. Unlike `ut`, `tt` increases uniformly without adjustments
             for changes in the Earth's rotation.
            
             The value in `tt` is used for calculations of movements not involving the Earth's rotation,
             such as the orbits of planets around the Sun, or the Moon around the Earth.
            
             Historically, Terrestrial Time has also been known by the term *Ephemeris Time* (ET).

            This function can be used in rare cases where a time must be based

            Most developers will want to invoke `new AstroTime(ut)` with a universal time
            instead of this function, because usually time is based on civil time adjusted
            by leap seconds to match the Earth's rotation, rather than the uniformly
            flowing TT used to calculate solar system dynamics. In rare cases
            where the caller already knows TT, this function is provided to create
            an `AstroTime` value that can be passed to Astronomy Engine functions.

             <remarks>
             The Earth's equator is not always in the same plane due to precession and nutation.
            
             Sometimes it is useful to have a fixed plane of reference for equatorial coordinates
             across different calendar dates.  In these cases, a fixed *epoch*, or reference time,
             is helpful. Astronomy Engine provides the J2000 epoch for such cases.  This refers
             to the plane of the Earth's orbit as it was on noon UTC on 1 January 2000.
            
             For some other purposes, it is more helpful to represent coordinates using the Earth's
             equator exactly as it is on that date. For example, when calculating rise/set times
             or horizontal coordinates, it is most accurate to use the orientation of the Earth's
             equator at that same date and time. For these uses, Astronomy Engine allows *of-date*
             calculations.

             </summary>
             <remarks>
             [Aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light) is an effect
             causing the apparent direction of an observed body to be shifted due to transverse
             movement of the Earth with respect to the rays of light coming from that body.
             This angular correction can be anywhere from 0 to about 20 arcseconds,
             depending on the position of the observed body relative to the instantaneous
             velocity vector of the Earth.
            
             Some Astronomy Engine functions allow optional correction for aberration by
             passing in a value of this enumerated type.
            
             Aberration correction is useful to improve accuracy of coordinates of
             apparent locations of bodies seen from the Earth.
             However, because aberration affects not only the observed body (such as a planet)
             but the surrounding stars, aberration may be unhelpful (for example)
             for determining exactly when a planet crosses from one constellation to another.

             For the Moon orbiting the Earth, or a planet orbiting the Sun, an *apsis* is an

             More specific terminology is common for particular orbiting bodies.
             The Moon's closest approach to the Earth is called *perigee* and its farthest
             point is called *apogee*. The closest approach of a planet to the Sun is called
             *perihelion* and the furthest point is called *aphelion*.

             <remarks>
             Returned by #Astronomy.SearchLunarEclipse or #Astronomy.NextLunarEclipse
             to report information about a lunar eclipse event.
             When a lunar eclipse is found, it is classified as penumbral, partial, or total.
             Penumbral eclipses are difficult to observe, because the Moon is only slightly dimmed
             by the Earth's penumbra; no part of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
             Partial eclipses occur when part, but not all, of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
             Total eclipses occur when the entire Moon passes into the Earth's umbra.
            
             The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Penumbral`, `EclipseKind.Partial`,
             or `EclipseKind.Total`, depending on the kind of lunar eclipse found.
            
             The `obscuration` field holds a value in the range [0, 1] that indicates what fraction
             of the Moon's apparent disc area is covered by the Earth's umbra at the eclipse's peak.
             This indicates how dark the peak eclipse appears. For penumbral eclipses, the obscuration
             is 0, because the Moon does not pass through the Earth's umbra. For partial eclipses,
             the obscuration is somewhere between 0 and 1. For total lunar eclipses, the obscuration is 1.
            
             Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
            
             Fields `sd_penum`, `sd_partial`, and `sd_total` hold the semi-duration of each phase
             of the eclipse, which is half of the amount of time the eclipse spends in each
             phase (expressed in minutes), or 0 if the eclipse never reaches that phase.
             By converting from minutes to days, and subtracting/adding with `peak`, the caller
             may determine the date and time of the beginning/end of each eclipse phase.

             to report information about a solar eclipse event.
            
             The eclipse is classified as partial, annular, or total, depending on the
             maximum amount of the Sun's disc obscured, as seen at the peak location
             on the surface of the Earth.
            
             The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Partial`, `EclipseKind.Annular`, or `EclipseKind.Total`.
             A total eclipse is when the peak observer sees the Sun completely blocked by the Moon.
             An annular eclipse is like a total eclipse, but the Moon is too far from the Earth's surface
             to completely block the Sun; instead, the Sun takes on a ring-shaped appearance.
             A partial eclipse is when the Moon blocks part of the Sun's disc, but nobody on the Earth
             observes either a total or annular eclipse.
            
             If `kind` is `EclipseKind.Total` or `EclipseKind.Annular`, the `latitude` and `longitude`
             fields give the geographic coordinates of the center of the Moon's shadow projected
             onto the daytime side of the Earth at the instant of the eclipse's peak.
             If `kind` has any other value, `latitude` and `longitude` are undefined and should
             not be used.
            
             For total or annular eclipses, the `obscuration` field holds the fraction (0, 1]
             of the Sun's apparent disc area that is blocked from view by the Moon's silhouette,
             as seen by an observer located at the geographic coordinates `latitude`, `longitude`
             at the darkest time `peak`. The value will always be 1 for total eclipses, and less than
             1 for annular eclipses.
             For partial eclipses, `obscuration` is undefined and should not be used.
             This is because there is little practical use for an obscuration value of
             a partial eclipse without supplying a particular observation location.
             Developers who wish to find an obscuration value for partial solar eclipses should therefore use
             #Astronomy.SearchLocalSolarEclipse and provide the geographic coordinates of an observer.

             <remarks>
             When reporting a solar eclipse observed at a specific location on the Earth
             (a "local" solar eclipse), a series of events occur. In addition
             to the time of each event, it is important to know the altitude of the Sun,
             because each event may be invisible to the observer if the Sun is below
             the horizon.
            
             If `altitude` is negative, the event is theoretical only; it would be
             visible if the Earth were transparent, but the observer cannot actually see it.
             If `altitude` is positive but less than a few degrees, visibility will be impaired by
             atmospheric interference (sunrise or sunset conditions).

             Returned by #Astronomy.SearchLocalSolarEclipse or #Astronomy.NextLocalSolarEclipse
             to report information about a solar eclipse as seen at a given geographic location.
            
             When a solar eclipse is found, it is classified as partial, annular, or total.
             The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Partial`, `EclipseKind.Annular`, or `EclipseKind.Total`.
             A partial solar eclipse is when the Moon does not line up directly enough with the Sun
             to completely block the Sun's light from reaching the observer.
             An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon's disc is completely visible against the Sun
             but the Moon is too far away to completely block the Sun's light; this leaves the
             Sun with a ring-like appearance.
             A total eclipse occurs when the Moon is close enough to the Earth and aligned with the
             Sun just right to completely block all sunlight from reaching the observer.
            
             The `obscuration` field reports what fraction of the Sun's disc appears blocked
             by the Moon when viewed by the observer at the peak eclipse time.
             This is a value that ranges from 0 (no blockage) to 1 (total eclipse).
             The obscuration value will be between 0 and 1 for partial eclipses and annular eclipses.
             The value will be exactly 1 for total eclipses. Obscuration gives an indication
             of how dark the eclipse appears.
            
             There are 5 "event" fields, each of which contains a time and a solar altitude.
             Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
             The fields `partial_begin` and `partial_end` are always set, and indicate when
             the eclipse begins/ends. If the eclipse reaches totality or becomes annular,
             `total_begin` and `total_end` indicate when the total/annular phase begins/ends.
             When an event field is valid, the caller must also check its `altitude` field to
             see whether the Sun is above the horizon at the time indicated by the `time` field.
             See #EclipseEvent for more information.

             visible against the Sun in its background.
             The `peak` field reports when the planet is most aligned with the Sun,
             as seen from the Earth.
             The `finish` field reports the last moment when the planet is visible
             against the Sun in its background.

             <remarks>
             This structure is returned by #Astronomy.RotationAxis to report
             the orientation of a body's rotation axis at a given moment in time.
             The axis is specified by the direction in space that the body's north pole
             points, using angular equatorial coordinates in the J2000 system (EQJ).
            
             Thus `ra` is the right ascension, and `dec` is the declination, of the
             body's north pole vector at the given moment in time. The north pole
             of a body is defined as the pole that lies on the north side of the
             [Solar System's invariable plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane),
             regardless of the body's direction of rotation.
            
             The `spin` field indicates the angular position of a prime meridian
             arbitrarily recommended for the body by the International Astronomical
             Union (IAU).
            
             The fields `ra`, `dec`, and `spin` correspond to the variables
             α0, δ0, and W, respectively, from
             [Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements: 2015](https://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Docs/WGCCRE/WGCCRE2015reprint.pdf).
            
             The field `north` is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the body's north pole.
             It is expressed in the J2000 mean equator system (EQJ).

            This class calculates the movement of arbitrary small bodies,

            It does so by calculating the gravitational forces on the small bodies

            This origin applies to all the input vectors provided in the

            Generally, bodies that stay in the outer Solar System and move slowly can

             <remarks>
             Sometimes it is helpful to "explore" various times near a given
             simulation time step, while repeatedly returning to the original
             time step. For example, when backdating a position for light travel
             time, the caller may wish to repeatedly try different amounts of
             backdating. When the backdating solver has converged, the caller
             wants to leave the simulation in its original state.
            
             This function allows a single "undo" of a simulation, and does so
             very efficiently.
            
             Usually this function will be called immediately after a matching
             call to #GravitySimulator.Update. It has the effect of rolling
             back the most recent update. If called twice in a row, it reverts
             the swap and thus has no net effect.
            
             The constructor initializes the current state and previous
             state to be identical. Both states represent the `time` parameter that was
             passed into the constructor. Therefore, `Swap` will
             have no effect from the caller's point of view when passed a simulator
             that has not yet been updated by a call to #GravitySimulator.Update.

             In order to simulate the movement of small bodies through the Solar System,

            For problems involving the gravitational interactions of Solar System bodies,
            it is helpful to know the product GM, where G = the universal gravitational constant

            <remarks>
            Given a date and time, this function calculates the rotation of the
            Earth, represented by the equatorial angle of the Greenwich prime meridian
            with respect to distant stars (not the Sun, which moves relative to background
            stars by almost one degree per day).
            This angle is called Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time (GAST).
            GAST is measured in sidereal hours in the half-open range [0, 24).
            When GAST = 0, it means the prime meridian is aligned with the of-date equinox,
            corrected at that time for precession and nutation of the Earth's axis.
            In this context, the "equinox" is the direction in space where the Earth's
            orbital plane (the ecliptic) intersects with the plane of the Earth's equator,
            at the location on the Earth's orbit of the (seasonal) March equinox.
            As the Earth rotates, GAST increases from 0 up to 24 sidereal hours,
            then starts over at 0.
            To convert to degrees, multiply the return value by 15.

             Given a time of observation, calculates the Moon's geocentric position

             longitude in degrees, and the geocentric distance in astronomical units (AU).
            
             The ecliptic angles are measured in "ECT": relative to the true ecliptic plane and
             equatorial plane at the specified time. This means the Earth's equator
             is corrected for precession and nutation, and the plane of the Earth's
             orbit is corrected for gradual obliquity drift.
            
             This algorithm is based on the Nautical Almanac Office's *Improved Lunar Ephemeris* of 1954,
             which in turn derives from E. W. Brown's lunar theories from the early twentieth century.
             It is adapted from Turbo Pascal code from the book

             Libration is an observed back-and-forth wobble of the portion of the

             When observing a distant object, for example Jupiter as seen from Earth,
             the amount of time it takes for light to travel from the object to the

             This function is a generic solver that figures out how long in the

             at the specified observation time. It uses #IPositionFunction
             to express an arbitrary position vector as a function of time.
            
             This function repeatedly calls `func.Position`, passing a series of time

             `func.Position` with more and more refined estimates of the time light must have
             left the target to arrive at the observer.
            
             For common use cases, it is simpler to use #Astronomy.BackdatePosition
             for calculating the light travel time correction of one body observing another body.
            
             For geocentric calculations, #Astronomy.GeoVector also backdates the returned
             position vector for light travel time, only it returns the observation time in
             the returned vector's `t` field rather than the backdated time.

             <remarks>
             When observing a distant object, for example Jupiter as seen from Earth,
             the amount of time it takes for light to travel from the object to the
             observer can significantly affect the object's apparent position.
            
             This function solves the light travel time correction for the apparent
             relative position vector of a target body as seen by an observer body
             at a given observation time.
            
             For geocentric calculations, #Astronomy.GeoVector also includes light
             travel time correction, but the time `t` embedded in its returned vector
             refers to the observation time, not the backdated time that light left
             the observed body. Thus `BackdatePosition` provides direct
             access to the light departure time for callers that need it.

             <remarks>
             Given a date and time, the geographic location of an observer on the Earth, and
             equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination) of a celestial body,
             this function returns horizontal coordinates (azimuth and altitude angles) for the body
             relative to the horizon at the geographic location.
            
             The right ascension `ra` and declination `dec` passed in must be *equator of date*
             coordinates, based on the Earth's true equator at the date and time of the observation.
             Otherwise the resulting horizontal coordinates will be inaccurate.
             Equator of date coordinates can be obtained by calling #Astronomy.Equator, passing in
             `EquatorEpoch.OfDate` as its `equdate` parameter. It is also recommended to enable
             aberration correction by passing in `Aberration.Corrected` as the `aberration` parameter.
            
             This function optionally corrects for atmospheric refraction.
             For most uses, it is recommended to pass `Refraction.Normal` in the `refraction` parameter to
             correct for optical lensing of the Earth's atmosphere that causes objects
             to appear somewhat higher above the horizon than they actually are.
             However, callers may choose to avoid this correction by passing in `Refraction.None`.
             If refraction correction is enabled, the azimuth, altitude, right ascension, and declination
             in the #Topocentric structure returned by this function will all be corrected for refraction.
             If refraction is disabled, none of these four coordinates will be corrected; in that case,
             the right ascension and declination in the returned structure will be numerically identical
             to the respective `ra` and `dec` values passed in.

             The returned value includes both Cartesian and spherical coordinates.
             The x-coordinate and longitude values in the returned structure are based
             on the *true equinox of date*: one of two points in the sky where the instantaneous
             plane of the Earth's equator at the given date and time (the *equatorial plane*)
             intersects with the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the *ecliptic plane*).
             By convention, the apparent location of the Sun at the March equinox is chosen

             Finds both equinoxes and both solstices for a given calendar year.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The changes of seasons are defined by solstices and equinoxes.
             Given a calendar year number, this function calculates the
             March and September equinoxes and the June and December solstices.
            
             The equinoxes are the moments twice each year when the plane of the
             Earth's equator passes through the center of the Sun. In other words,
             the Sun's declination is zero at both equinoxes.
             The March equinox defines the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere
             and the beginning of autumn in the southern hemisphere.
             The September equinox defines the beginning of autumn in the northern hemisphere
             and the beginning of spring in the southern hemisphere.
            
             The solstices are the moments twice each year when one of the Earth's poles
             is most tilted toward the Sun. More precisely, the Sun's declination reaches
             its minimum value at the December solstice, which defines the beginning of
             winter in the northern hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the southern
             hemisphere. The Sun's declination reaches its maximum value at the June solstice,
             which defines the beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere and the beginning
             of winter in the southern hemisphere.

             The function searches the window of time specified by `startTime` and `startTime+limitDays`.

             Searches for a time at which a function's value increases through zero.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Certain astronomy calculations involve finding a time when an event occurs.
             Often such events can be defined as the root of a function:
             the time at which the function's value becomes zero.
            
             `Search` finds the *ascending root* of a function: the time at which
             the function's value becomes zero while having a positive slope. That is, as time increases,
             the function transitions from a negative value, through zero at a specific moment,
             to a positive value later. The goal of the search is to find that specific moment.
            
             The `func` parameter is an instance of the abstract class #SearchContext.
             As an example, a caller may wish to find the moment a celestial body reaches a certain
             ecliptic longitude. In that case, the caller might derive a class that contains
             a #Body member to specify the body and a `double` to hold the target longitude.
             It could subtract the target longitude from the actual longitude at a given time;
             thus the difference would equal zero at the moment in time the planet reaches the
             desired longitude.
            
             The search calls `func.Eval` repeatedly to rapidly narrow in on any ascending
             root within the time window specified by `t1` and `t2`. The search never
             reports a solution outside this time window.
            
             `Search` uses a combination of bisection and quadratic interpolation
             to minimize the number of function calls. However, it is critical that the
             supplied time window be small enough that there cannot be more than one root
             (ascedning or descending) within it; otherwise the search can fail.
             Beyond that, it helps to make the time window as small as possible, ideally
             such that the function itself resembles a smooth parabolic curve within that window.
            
             If an ascending root is not found, or more than one root
             (ascending and/or descending) exists within the window `t1`..`t2`,
             the search will return `null`.
            
             If the search does not converge within 20 iterations, it will throw an exception.

             The function returns an angle in the half-open range [0, 360) degrees.
             The value is the ecliptic longitude of `body1` relative to the ecliptic

             When the angle is 180 degrees, it means the two bodies appear on opposite sides
             of the sky for an Earthly observer.

             Lunar phases are conventionally defined in terms of the Moon's geocentric ecliptic

             When the Moon and the Sun have the same longitude, that is defined as a new moon.

             If you want to iterate through lunar quarters (new moon, first quarter, full moon, third quarter)

             <summary>
             Searches for the next time a celestial body rises or sets as seen by an observer on the Earth.
             </summary>
            
             <remarks>
             This function finds the next rise or set time of the Sun, Moon, or planet other than the Earth.
             Rise time is when the body first starts to be visible above the horizon.
             For example, sunrise is the moment that the top of the Sun first appears to peek above the horizon.
             Set time is the moment when the body appears to vanish below the horizon.
             Therefore, this function adjusts for the apparent angular radius of the observed body
             (significant only for the Sun and Moon).
            
             This function corrects for a typical value of atmospheric refraction, which causes celestial
             bodies to appear higher above the horizon than they would if the Earth had no atmosphere.
             Astronomy Engine uses a correction of 34 arcminutes. Real-world refraction varies based
             on air temperature, pressure, and humidity; such weather-based conditions are outside
             the scope of Astronomy Engine.
            
             Note that rise or set may not occur in every 24 hour period.
             For example, near the Earth's poles, there are long periods of time where
             the Sun stays below the horizon, never rising.
             Also, it is possible for the Moon to rise just before midnight but not set during the subsequent 24-hour day.
             This is because the Moon sets nearly an hour later each day due to orbiting the Earth a
             significant amount during each rotation of the Earth.
             Therefore callers must not assume that the function will always succeed.

             Finds the next time the center of a body passes through a given altitude.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Finds when the center of the given body ascends or descends through a given
             altitude angle, as seen by an observer at the specified location on the Earth.
             By using the appropriate combination of `direction` and `altitude` parameters,
             this function can be used to find when civil, nautical, or astronomical twilight
             begins (dawn) or ends (dusk).
            
             Civil dawn begins before sunrise when the Sun ascends through 6 degrees below
             the horizon. To find civil dawn, pass `Direction.Rise` for `direction` and -6 for `altitude`.
            
             Civil dusk ends after sunset when the Sun descends through 6 degrees below the horizon.
             To find civil dusk, pass `Direction.Set` for `direction` and -6 for `altitude`.
            
             Nautical twilight is similar to civil twilight, only the `altitude` value should be -12 degrees.
            
             Astronomical twilight uses -18 degrees as the `altitude` value.
            
             By convention for twilight time calculations, the altitude is not corrected for
             atmospheric refraction. This is because the target altitudes are below the horizon,
             and refraction is not directly observable.
            
             `SearchAltitude` is not intended to find rise/set times of a body for two reasons:
             (1) Rise/set times of the Sun or Moon are defined by their topmost visible portion, not their centers.
             (2) Rise/set times are affected significantly by atmospheric refraction.
             Therefore, it is better to use #Astronomy.SearchRiseSet to find rise/set times, which
             corrects for both of these considerations.
            
             `SearchAltitude` will not work reliably for altitudes at or near the body's
             maximum or minimum altitudes. To find the time a body reaches minimum or maximum altitude
             angles, use #Astronomy.SearchHourAngle.

            The *hour angle* of a celestial body indicates its position in the sky with respect

            The hour angle is 0 when the body's center reaches its highest angle above the horizon in a given day.
            The hour angle increases by 1 unit for every sidereal hour that passes after that point, up
            to 24 sidereal hours when it reaches the highest point again. So the hour angle indicates

             <summary>
             Searches for the time when the Earth and another planet are separated by a specified angle
             in ecliptic longitude, as seen from the Sun.
             </summary>
            
             <remarks>
             A relative longitude is the angle between two bodies measured in the plane of the Earth's orbit
             (the ecliptic plane). The distance of the bodies above or below the ecliptic plane is ignored.
             If you imagine the shadow of the body cast onto the ecliptic plane, and the angle measured around
             that plane from one body to the other in the direction the planets orbit the Sun, you will get an
             angle somewhere between 0 and 360 degrees. This is the relative longitude.
            
             Given a planet other than the Earth in `body` and a time to start the search in `startTime`,
             this function searches for the next time that the relative longitude measured from the planet
             to the Earth is `targetRelLon`.
            
             Certain astronomical events are defined in terms of relative longitude between the Earth and another planet:
            
             - When the relative longitude is 0 degrees, it means both planets are in the same direction from the Sun.
               For planets that orbit closer to the Sun (Mercury and Venus), this is known as *inferior conjunction*,
               a time when the other planet becomes very difficult to see because of being lost in the Sun's glare.
               (The only exception is in the rare event of a transit, when we see the silhouette of the planet passing
               between the Earth and the Sun.)
            
             - When the relative longitude is 0 degrees and the other planet orbits farther from the Sun,
               this is known as *opposition*.  Opposition is when the planet is closest to the Earth, and
               also when it is visible for most of the night, so it is considered the best time to observe the planet.
            
             - When the relative longitude is 180 degrees, it means the other planet is on the opposite side of the Sun
               from the Earth. This is called *superior conjunction*. Like inferior conjunction, the planet is
               very difficult to see from the Earth. Superior conjunction is possible for any planet other than the Earth.

                in the morning before sunrise, or in the evening after sunset.
            
             - `elongation` is the angle in degrees between two vectors: one from the center of the Earth to the
                center of the Sun, the other from the center of the Earth to the center of the specified body.
                This angle indicates how far away the body is from the glare of the Sun.

             Finds a date and time when Mercury or Venus reaches its maximum angle from the Sun as seen from the Earth.
             </summary>
            
             <remarks>
             Mercury and Venus are are often difficult to observe because they are closer to the Sun than the Earth is.
             Mercury especially is almost always impossible to see because it gets lost in the Sun's glare.
             The best opportunities for spotting Mercury, and the best opportunities for viewing Venus through
             a telescope without atmospheric interference, are when these planets reach maximum elongation.
             These are events where the planets reach the maximum angle from the Sun as seen from the Earth.
            
             This function solves for those times, reporting the next maximum elongation event's date and time,
             the elongation value itself, the relative longitude with the Sun, and whether the planet is best
             observed in the morning or evening. See #Astronomy.Elongation for more details about the returned structure.

             Finds visual magnitude, phase angle, and other illumination information about a celestial body.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This function calculates information about how bright a celestial body appears from the Earth,
             reported as visual magnitude, which is a smaller (or even negative) number for brighter objects
             and a larger number for dimmer objects.
            
             For bodies other than the Sun, it reports a phase angle, which is the angle in degrees between
             the Sun and the Earth, as seen from the center of the body. Phase angle indicates what fraction
             of the body appears illuminated as seen from the Earth. For example, when the phase angle is
             near zero, it means the body appears "full" as seen from the Earth.  A phase angle approaching
             180 degrees means the body appears as a thin crescent as seen from the Earth.  A phase angle
             of 90 degrees means the body appears "half full".
             For the Sun, the phase angle is always reported as 0; the Sun emits light rather than reflecting it,
             so it doesn't have a phase angle.
            
             When the body is Saturn, the returned structure contains a field `ring_tilt` that holds
             the tilt angle in degrees of Saturn's rings as seen from the Earth. A value of 0 means
             the rings appear edge-on, and are thus nearly invisible from the Earth. The `ring_tilt` holds
             0 for all bodies other than Saturn.

             <remarks>
             This function searches for the date and time Venus appears brightest as seen from the Earth.
             Currently only Venus is supported for the `body` parameter, though this could change in the future.
             Mercury's peak magnitude occurs at superior conjunction, when it is virtually impossible to see from the Earth,
             so peak magnitude events have little practical value for that planet.
             Planets other than Venus and Mercury reach peak magnitude at opposition, which can
             be found using #Astronomy.SearchRelativeLongitude.
             The Moon reaches peak magnitude at full moon, which can be found using
             #Astronomy.SearchMoonQuarter or #Astronomy.SearchMoonPhase.
             The Sun reaches peak magnitude at perihelion, which occurs each year in January.
             However, the difference is minor and has little practical value.

             Given a more massive "major" body and a much less massive "minor" body,
             calculates one of the five Lagrange points in relation to the minor body's
             orbit around the major body. The parameter `point` is an integer that
             selects the Lagrange point as follows:
            
             1 = the Lagrange point between the major body and minor body.
             2 = the Lagrange point on the far side of the minor body.
             3 = the Lagrange point on the far side of the major body.
             4 = the Lagrange point 60 degrees ahead of the minor body's orbital position.
             5 = the Lagrange point 60 degrees behind the minor body's orbital position.
            
             The function returns the state vector for the selected Lagrange point
             in J2000 mean equator coordinates (EQJ), with respect to the center of the
             major body.
            
             To calculate Sun/Earth Lagrange points, pass in `Body.Sun` for `major_body`
             and `Body.EMB` (Earth/Moon barycenter) for `minor_body`.
             For Lagrange points of the Sun and any other planet, pass in just that planet
             (e.g. `Body.Jupiter`) for `minor_body`.
             To calculate Earth/Moon Lagrange points, pass in `Body.Earth` and `Body.Moon`
             for the major and minor bodies respectively.
            
             In some cases, it may be more efficient to call #Astronomy.LagrangePointFast,
             especially when the state vectors have already been calculated, or are needed

             Given a more massive "major" body and a much less massive "minor" body,
             calculates one of the five Lagrange points in relation to the minor body's
             orbit around the major body. The parameter `point` is an integer that

             5 = the Lagrange point 60 degrees behind the minor body's orbital position.
            
             The caller passes in the state vector and mass for both bodies.
             The state vectors can be in any orientation and frame of reference.
             The body masses are expressed as GM products, where G = the universal
             gravitation constant and M = the body's mass. Thus the units for
             `major_mass` and `minor_mass` must be au^3/day^2.
             Use #Astronomy.MassProduct to obtain GM values for various solar system bodies.
            
             The function returns the state vector for the selected Lagrange point
             using the same orientation as the state vector parameters `major_state` and `minor_state`,
             and the position and velocity components are with respect to the major body's center.
            
             Consider calling #Astronomy.LagrangePoint, instead of this function, for simpler usage in most cases.

             <remarks>
             Given a horizontal Cartesian vector, returns horizontal azimuth and altitude.
            
             *IMPORTANT:* This function differs from #Astronomy.SphereFromVector in two ways:
             - `Astronomy.SphereFromVector` returns a `lon` value that represents azimuth defined counterclockwise
               from north (e.g., west = +90), but this function represents a clockwise rotation
               (e.g., east = +90). The difference is because `Astronomy.SphereFromVector` is intended
               to preserve the vector "right-hand rule", while this function defines azimuth in a more
               traditional way as used in navigation and cartography.
             - This function optionally corrects for atmospheric refraction, while `Astronomy.SphereFromVector`
               does not.
            
             The returned structure contains the azimuth in `lon`.
             It is measured in degrees clockwise from north: east = +90 degrees, west = +270 degrees.
            
             The altitude is stored in `lat`.
            
             The distance to the observed object is stored in `dist`,
             and is expressed in astronomical units (AU).

            <remarks>
            Given an altitude angle and a refraction option, calculates
            the amount of "lift" caused by atmospheric refraction.
            This is the number of degrees higher in the sky an object appears
            due to the lensing of the Earth's atmosphere.
            This function works best near sea level.
            To correct for higher elevations, call #Astronomy.Atmosphere for that
            elevation and multiply the refraction angle by the resulting relative density.

            Source: ECL = ecliptic system, using equator at J2000 epoch.
            Target: HOR = horizontal system.
            </remarks>
            <param name="time">
            The date and time of the desired horizontal orientation.
            </param>
            <param name="observer">
            A location near the Earth's mean sea level that defines the observer's horizon.
            </param>
            <returns>
            A rotation matrix that converts ECL to HOR at `time` and for `observer`.
            The components of the horizontal vector are:
            x = north, y = west, z = zenith (straight up from the observer).
            These components are chosen so that the "right-hand rule" works for the vector
            and so that north represents the direction where azimuth = 0.
