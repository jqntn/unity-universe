    <description>Astronomy Engine calculates Sun, Moon, and planet positions.
It predicts lunar phases, eclipses, transits, oppositions, conjunctions, equinoxes, solstices,
rise/set times, and other events. It provides vector and angular coordinate transforms among
equatorial, ecliptic, horizontal, and galactic orientations.

- Provides calculations for the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

- Calculates all supported objects for any calendar date and time for millennia before or after the present.

- Provides heliocentric and geocentric Cartesian vectors of all the above bodies.

- Determines apparent horizon-based positions for an observer anywhere on the Earth, given that observer's latitude, longitude, and elevation in meters. Optionally corrects for atmospheric refraction.

- Calculates rise, set, and culmination times of Sun, Moon, and planets.

- Finds civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight times (dusk and dawn).

- Finds date and time of Moon phases: new, first quarter, full, third quarter (or anywhere in between as expressed in degrees of ecliptic longitude).

- Predicts lunar and solar eclipses.

- Predicts transits of Mercury and Venus.

- Predicts lunar apogee and perigee dates, times, and distances.

- Predicts date and time of equinoxes and solstices for a given calendar year.

- Determines apparent visual magnitudes of all the supported celestial bodies.

- Predicts dates of planetary conjunctions, oppositions, and apsides.

- Predicts dates of Venus' peak visual magnitude.

- Predicts dates of maximum elongation for Mercury and Venus.

- Calculates the positions of Jupiter's four largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

- Allows custom simulation of the movements of user-defined small bodies, such as asteroids and comets, through the Solar System.

- Converts angular and vector coordinates among the following orientations:
  Equatorial J2000,
  Equatorial equator-of-date,
  Ecliptic J2000,
  Topocentric Horizontal,
  Galactic (IAU 1958).

- Determines which constellation contains a given point in the sky.

- Calculates libration of the Moon.

- Calculates axis orientation and rotation angles for the Sun, Moon, and planets.</description>
